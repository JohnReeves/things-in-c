# things-in-c
some examples of c programs that kids can do in repl.it

eg:   
* sorting;   
* ciphers;   
* images;   
* geometry;   
* quizzes;   
* time;   
* maths questions;   
* calculator;   
* rpn calculator;   
* rock-paper-scissors;   


ie anything kids are asked to do in Python in school, they could easily do in c
